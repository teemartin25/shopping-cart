# ShoppingCart

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.0.

## Description:

This is a mobile responsive project that contains all basic capabilities of an e-commerce web app.

## Features:

Add To Cart capability on all product items. Create, Read, Update, Delete via Firebase database. Each profile can also be edited and has it’s own order history page.

## Built with:

HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Angular, Bootstrap, Angular Material, Firebase Realtime Database

## Usage:

If you want to login as an admin, just add the word “admin” to your email address when signing up, it will then give you full admin functionality where it will allow you to perform CRUD operations to all products.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Future improvements:

Might add some animations when choosing a category so that when you hover on each category, you’ll have a more smooth transition. (applies only to non-admin accounts)

## FAQs:

Question: How can I add products and categories?
Answer: You need to have an admin account. All email addresses that contains the word “admin” will have an admin account.
